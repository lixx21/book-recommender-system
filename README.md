# Dataset Info

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several csv on that dataset:
1. Book's lists dataset
2. Book's users dataset
3. Book's Ratings dataset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total of the dataset if you merge them is **1.149.780 rows and 12 columns** but there are also several missing values and several duplicate book's title, therefore I handle it by remove them and I got **205.170 rows and 12 columns** but In this case I only used 10.000 dataset because my computer can not handle more dataset, but you can used dataset as much as you want.
